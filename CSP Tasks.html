    <h2>Explore</h2>

    <p>The explore task for AP Computer Science is one part of the AP exam for this class. The task is assigned during class and 8 hours of in class time are allotted to complete it. The student is tasked with researching a computing innovation and creating an artifact like one of the diagram or video shown on the <a href="Artifacts.html">Artifacts Webpage</a>. This compuational artifact has to either display the function, purpose, or societal impact. The second part of the task is a series of written responses that reveals the research done into the computing innovation. These range from how the innovation uses data, to the meathods you used to create the artifact. Lastly, it is notable to mention that the written responses have a limited word count per question. </p>

    <h2>Create</h2>

    <p>The explore task for AP Computer Science is another part of the AP Exam for this class. The task is also assigned during class and 12 hours of in class time are allocated towards completing the task. The student is requried to develop a unique computer program that implements functions, logic, and mathematics. As well as create a video showing the function of the program and type written responses that explain the program and how it implements abstraction and logic. The written responses also have a limited word count per question as well. The video itself must be less than 60 seconds.</p>

    <p>This is an example of the program created by a student, which displays the afore mentioned requirements of the create task, as the video demonstrates the way that the program functions. Below is an pdf file containing an example of the written responses done by the same student. </p>

    <h2>Multiple Choice</h2>
    
    <p>The multiple choice portion of the AP Exam for computer science principles is 2 hours long and includes 53 questions. These questions follow standard AP testing procedure at the specified testing location for your area. The questions are based on the big ideas of computer science principles that are taught in this class as well as mentioned on the <a href="Artifacts.html">Big Ideas Webpage</a>. They will be based on many concepts of computer science, like base converting, boolean, and conditional loops. Sample questions for the multiple choice begin on page 92 of the Exam Description.</p>
